# PoolArena Demo Interface

## ðŸŽ¬ Quick Demo Setup

This is a simple HTML interface to showcase PoolArena's smart contract functionality for hackathon demos.

### Option 1: Static Demo (No Deployment Needed)

2. The interface will show in "Demo Mode"
3. All interactions are simulated for demonstration purposes

### Option 2: Connect to Deployed Contracts
1. Deploy your contracts using the deployment script
2. Update the contract addresses in `index.html`:
   ```javascript
   const CONTRACT_CONFIG = {
       POOL_ARENA: '0xYourDeployedPoolArenaAddress',
       HOOK: '0xYourDeployedHookAddress',
       UNICHAIN_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID: '0x515' // 1301 in hex
   };
   ```
3. Serve the HTML file (use Live Server in VS Code or any local server)
4. Connect your MetaMask to Unichain Sepolia
5. Interact with real contracts!
